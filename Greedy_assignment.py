"""
This class recives a RTV_graph ,  and greedly assing trips to vehicles by the least cost.
public attributes :
@ assigned_tv : a set of assigned_tv tuples  (Type: Trip t ,Vehicle v,Possitve number cost )
 usefull to extract the exact assingments by the algo.
@ r_ok:  a set of request that are assinged by our algo.
@ v_ok: a set of vehicles that got new trips assinged to them.

!!!!! The class does not update any other class at all.
so the object of vehicle does NOT know what requests are assinged to it , this class only holds "assigned_tv"
so object need to be updated by this elsewhere.
